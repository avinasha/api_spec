Api Spec
========

A collection of RSpec matchers to make testing JSON API easy.

Install
-------

Usage
-----

First you need to require api_spec in your spec_helper.rb:

```
  require 'api_spec'
```

You will then need to include ApiSpec::Matchers in your example groups.
If you want to have access to the helpers and matchers in all of your examples you can do the following in your spec_helper.rb:

```
Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
  config.include(ApiSpec::Matchers)
end
```

Otherwise, you will need to include them in the example groups you wish to use them:

```
describe "TicketsController" do
  include ApiSpec::Matchers
  ...
end
```

ApiSpec::Matchers are created to be used in testing JSON responses
generated by rails in RSpec controller specs. So you need to call
`render_views` in your controller spec file.

```
describe TicketsController do
  render_views
  ...
end
```

Now you can use the matchers on the `response` object

```
it "should respond with status 200" do
  get :index
  response.should have_status(200)
end
```
